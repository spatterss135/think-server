# The Social App #
### By Sergio Sandoval, Samuel Patterson, and Jack Ersbo ###

This is a small social networking application whose client was built in ReactJS with styling from MaterialUI. The server was built using an Express application with data management in PostgresSQL. 

The app's functionality includes the ability to make posts, follow other users, filter posts based on your follows, edit your posts, and delete your posts. Other features are currently in development so please stay tuned!
